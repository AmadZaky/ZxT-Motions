# ZxT-Motions v1.0.0 — Official Release


Formerly MotionAstra. Use the new installer after the repository rename.

**Platform: Windows only. macOS support is withdrawn for this build.**

Offline CEP extension for Adobe After Effects 2025. Studio UI with dark/light themes and five accent colors, local CSInterface + Lucide, Text Animate (6 highlighted Text Tools FX + 120 animation presets), 8 procedural SolidGen presets and Quick Tools with integrated FX settings.

Download only **Install ZxT-Motions.exe** from the release assets. Close AE, open it and consent to downloading and installing ZxT-Motions. Setup fetches its matching release from GitHub over HTTPS, verifies the digest and installs the panel. Confirm replacement of older versions, restart AE, then open Window → Extensions → ZxT-Motions. The GitHub source archive is for development; use the release asset for the ready-to-install package. The package is unsigned source; no Adobe installation or signing certificate is bundled. Internet is required by the EXE installer. The installed panel works offline. The ZIP remains an advanced/manual fallback.

## Control & reliability (v3.6)

- **Layer Inspector:** expand the selection summary in Quick to see layer names/types, locks, detected core FX, IN/OUT Text Animate phases and native effect names. Load the matching settings from there. Selection is polled every four seconds and on focus; Refresh selection requests it immediately. Host validation always checks the real selection at execution time.
- **Target-aware actions:** text FX require unlocked text layers; SolidGen only needs an open composition. Update on a loaded instance is disabled after selection changes. Load the new target to continue. Mixed selections apply to valid text layers and report skipped layers.
- **Animation controls:** parameter badges distinguish **AE keyframes** (Progress and Choice). Enable Manual Progress before animating the native Progress slider. Text Switcher needs Choice slider mode before animating `MA2 choice`. Explicit panel edits to keyed controls add/update a key at the playhead; unrelated updates leave their keys alone. A custom expression must be edited in AE first.
- **Colors and artwork:** unchanged native colors retain keys/expressions. An explicit color edit adds a key at the playhead if already keyed. Version upgrades refresh owned expressions without rebuilding background artwork. Count changes are blocked when rebuilding would erase custom artwork animation. Generate another background to use a different count.
- **Text Animate:** previews say **Motion**. Apply/Save settings replace the selected IN/OUT phase; custom keys or edited expressions on that phase block replacement. Edit those in AE, or use the explicit Remove animation action first. Other phases and unrelated animators remain intact.
- **Favorites & Recent:** use ☆ on any core or Text Animate card. Text, SolidGen and Create have independent All/Favorites/Recent filters, using the same saved collections. Create cards can be favorited and successful layer creation is recorded in Recent. The most recent 20 successfully applied/updated presets are saved; failed operations are excluded. Collections stay on this computer and work offline. They are separate from project files.

## Studio workspace

Studio keeps Library, Motion and Create in one row. Text and SolidGen live in Library; Quick Tools and Curve live in Motion. At widths below 760 px, Customize opens a separate view; choose **Back to Library** to return. Wider panels keep the library beside the selected preset. Text Tools FX and Text Animate collections can collapse independently. Apply/Update stay above the status area.

Choose the gear button → **Appearance** to select Orange, Lime Green, Light Blue, Burgundy or Plain White. Use the sun/moon button for dark/light mode. Both choices persist locally and affect only the interface, never preset artwork or AE color values. Search and Quick/Menu collapse controls remain in the header.

## Current workflow

Select a text layer for Text Tools FX in the Text Animate tab. Background Generate needs only an active composition; it creates one layer or updates selected matching instances. Deselect backgrounds to deliberately create another. Customize preserves your draft colors; Generate/Update writes them directly into native Gradient Ramp/Tint properties. These colors do not depend on color expressions.

Loop mode is a dropdown: Ping-Pong, Cycle (default), Continue, None (play once and hold). Continue advances normalized animation time beyond Duration; finite text reveals naturally finish while procedural motion keeps advancing. Manual Progress overrides looping. Existing project expressions stay unchanged until Update; legacy checkbox instances migrate to Cycle unless another mode is chosen.

Apply/Generate and Update are compact adjacent buttons at the inspector bottom. Load settings in the Tools Bar follows the active Text Tools or Text Animate tab. Text Apply / Update refreshes the same preset already on a layer instead of stacking another instance. After loading Text Animate settings, use Save changes; Remove restores Apply. Unwanted old duplicate layers are not deleted automatically.

## Quick Tools and FX settings

New FX use one **MotionAstra Progress** parameter controller. Native effects needed to render the artwork remain in Effect Controls. Use **Quick Tools → FX settings → Load selected FX**, search or expand parameter groups, then **Update selected FX**. Updates are bound to the loaded layer; reload if you change selection. Enable Manual Progress to animate the single progress slider.

Existing instances keep their controls. **Compact old controls** converts an unanimated instance; it refuses animated controls and external expression dependencies to protect existing projects. Settings → control layout → Individual keeps separate controls for advanced keyframing.

## Copy / Paste Motion — presets and Transform

In **Motion → Quick Tools → Copy / Paste Motion**, select exactly one source layer and click **Copy Motion**. Copy captures known ZxT preset settings and Text Animate/YUGraphic IN/OUT settings, plus any supported Anchor Point, Position, Scale, Rotation/Z Rotation and Opacity keyframes. Managed control keyframes (including Choice, Progress and native color controllers) are included. Preset setups are regenerated through the existing engines. Custom expressions on known Text Animate/YUGraphic selector Amount properties are included verbatim, with their enabled/disabled state. Built-in selector expressions still regenerate at the CTI. Custom code keeps its original time logic and layer/effect name references; references must exist in the target composition. Arbitrary user effects, masks, other text animators, other expressions, artwork and parenting are not copied. Existing target presets and authored selector keyframes remain protected. Copy is read-only and creates no undo step.

Select one or more targets, put the playhead at the desired start, and click **Paste Motion**. The earliest copied preset phase/start marker or keyframe becomes offset zero; all keys use `CTI + offset` in seconds. Compatible targets receive the same timing without staggering. Separated Position axes require matching separated target Position; dimensions and spatial types must match. There is no conversion between 2D/3D or separated/unified Position.

**Preset conflict policy:** a target with an existing managed preset/control/animator is skipped. Core presets also refuse existing Transform/Source Text animation and incompatible layer types. Background setups paste onto compatible selected solids without generating extra layers. Copied Text Animate phases must fit within the target layer. Layer timing stays unchanged.

**Transform conflict policy:** any destination property already containing keyframes is skipped, even outside the pasted range. Properties with an expression, including disabled expressions, are also skipped. Other empty, compatible properties can still be pasted. This protects old roving timing and automatic tangents as well as time collisions. A failed property paste removes only its new keys and restores its old static value; failed rollback asks you to check the timeline and Undo once.

Paste uses one **Paste ZxT Motion** undo group. Interpolation, ease, spatial tangents and supported continuity/auto-Bezier flags are transferred. Interior spatial roving is retained only if AE keeps the requested relative timing; otherwise that property is restored. Clipboard data is local to the open panel session and disappears on reload. Failed recopy clears the previous buffer. Existing Favorites/Recent lists are not used as a clipboard.

See `docs/OFFICIAL_V1_REPAIR_VALIDATION.md` and `docs/TRANSFORM_MOTION_VALIDATION.md` for coverage and required native AE checks.

## Text Animate · by YUGraphic

The Text Animate tab starts with a collapsible **Text Tools FX** section (its open/closed state is remembered), containing **6 Text Tools FX** (Counter Text, Text Switcher, Kinetic Stretch, Burning Ember, Retro VHS and Matrix Code), then offers **120 original YUGraphic text presets** in 12 categories: Clean, Slide, Pop, Bounce, Elastic, Rotate, Blur, Typewriter, Glitch, Split, Wave and Kinetic. Select text layers, choose a preset, Customize, then Apply animation. Options include IN/OUT/BOTH, grouping, duration, stagger, intensity, seed, order, easing and placement. Colors/fonts remain native text properties.

Load YU settings reads one selected instance; Update loaded YU checks that selection still matches. The mode selector determines whether Load prefers IN or OUT. Apply replaces only its chosen YU phase; Remove YU removes both phases. Parameter changes take effect on Apply/Update, and the YU tab stores them without extra Effect Controls sliders. Current playhead placement is recalculated on each Apply/Update. BOTH always uses layer edges, as in the original engine. These finite IN/OUT animations do not use MotionAstra loop modes or markers.

Animation math and text animator setup come from the supplied MIT-licensed engine. Credits and the original license are included in `vendor/yu-text-motion/LICENSE.txt` and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md. Canvas typography is illustrative; native AE rendering still needs visual verification. The archive's separate Object/Shape collection is outside this text-tab integration.

## Motion Curve and themes

Open **Motion Curve**, choose one of eight easing shapes or drag the two Bézier handles. Numeric inputs and keyboard arrows provide precise edits; Mirror reverses the timing feel. The preview shows normalized progress over time. Select adjacent property keyframes in AE, then **Apply Curve to selected keyframes**. The tool writes native temporal easing without moving keyframes or adding expressions.

Only intervals with both endpoints selected are modified. Scalar and 2D/3D properties are supported. Active expressions, roving keys and non-numeric properties are skipped with a message. Curved spatial paths support zero endpoint speed (Out progress 0, In progress 1); for custom nonzero endpoint speed use separate Position dimensions. Per-property rollback protects existing easing if a native write fails. Temporal auto/continuous modes are disabled for edited keys so the requested handles remain independent.

Use **Light / Dark** in the header to switch themes. Theme and the last curve persist locally. The orange accent, reserved action footer and existing Text/YU/Background/Tools/Tweaker workflows remain available. Preview artwork keeps its own artistic background colors.

## Text Switcher — animated Choice

Choose **Switch mode → Choice slider**, then Apply or Update. In AE Effect Controls, animate **MA2 choice**: 1 selects the first phrase, 2 the second, and so on. This native slider is available even in Compact mode; Switcher keeps Progress plus Choice, while other compact FX keep their existing controllers. Automatic mode deliberately ignores Choice.

For existing instances, select the text layer, open **Quick Tools → Load selected FX**, then click Update once to add the new control and refresh its expression. After changing Choice inside the panel, click Update. If Choice already has keys, an explicit panel edit writes a key at the current time; unrelated updates preserve its animation. Refresh loaded settings after manually editing the native slider.

## Global search and previews

Click the magnifying glass beside the theme switch to open search across Text Tools FX, Text Animate, SolidGen, Quick Tools, Motion Curve, Create and Settings. Results open a preset inspector or focus its tool; they do not apply effects or create layers. Escape closes search. Preview cards and inspectors use square 1:1 canvases; animation samples read “MotionAstra”. The separate Load animation settings button is removed. The Quick bar Load settings follows the active editor; outside the animation editor it loads core MotionAstra FX settings.

## Create tab

Open **Create** alongside the FX and tool tabs. Cards appear in the order **Text → Shape → Solid Color**. All creation actions need an active composition and create one native, editable layer with one Undo step.

- **Shape:** choose Circle, Square or Polygon; set size and fill color. Polygon exposes a sides field (3–64). Shape paths remain editable in AE.
- **Text:** enter content, search the AE font list, choose **Font family** and **Style** separately, then set font size and color. Italic, Medium, Semibold and Bold are offered when those faces are installed for the selected family; no artificial styles are substituted. A live preview follows your text, selected face/style, color and size (scaled to fit the panel). If CEP cannot load that font, the preview explicitly labels the fallback; the exact native PostScript face is still sent to AE. Use Refresh fonts after activating fonts. Current AE font keeps the default family.
- **Solid Color:** use the color picker or enter six-digit HEX with or without `#`. Create background makes one full-composition solid at the bottom of the stack. Up to eight recently used colors persist locally and can be selected again; only successful creations enter history.

Shapes and text begin at the playhead. Backgrounds span the entire composition. These controls create new layers; they do not restyle existing layers or change SolidGen's procedural recipes. The compact Quick bar keeps Center anchor and Load settings accessible elsewhere.

## Removed collections

FXTools is removed from the panel and installation payload. Panning Transition and Gold Extrusion are also removed from the active catalog as of 3.0.7. 3D Glass, Liquid Gold, Blueprint CAD and Glassmorphism are removed from the active catalog. Existing layers and expressions are not deleted by upgrading. Removed preset instances are no longer editable through the panel; keep a project backup and use AE's native controls or the prior release if needed. Historical source adapters remain in the development repository for regression coverage.

## Versioning and releases

Run `python3 tools/bump-version.py` once before each new code push to main. Versions follow 2.8.1, 2.8.2, etc. CI rejects a push whose version is not the next patch after its parent. After tests pass, CI creates a new prerelease and installable ZIP; older releases are preserved. Re-running the same successful commit does not increment its version.

## Source layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| CSXS/manifest.xml | AEFT host range, CEP runtime, panel geometry |
| index.html | Accessible panel, cards, tools and inspector |
| css/style.css | Dark theme, responsive layout, reserved status area |
| js/main.js | Filtering, category state, card Apply, parameter inspector, tool events |
| js/bridge.js | CSInterface evalScript transport, reply validation and recovery |
| jsx/hostscript.jsx | ES3 host, recipes, ownership, timeline and tools |
| presets.json | Authoritative schema: 20 catalog presets + legacy records |
| js/presets-data.js, jsx/presets-data.jsx | Generated offline schema bundles |
| js/preview.js | Illustrative canvas previews for every card |
| vendor/ | Pinned local CSInterface and Lucide with notices |
| catalog.html | Single-file offline preview; cannot apply from a normal browser |
| install-windows.ps1 | Optional per-user installer helpers |
| tests/ | Host model, transport/UI regressions and real-AE smoke script |

Counter and Text Switcher retain their preset IDs. Old v2 recipe instances remain editable through Load selected FX; the catalog contains only the 20 current cards. Projects are not migrated automatically.

The host targets AEFT 18.0–25.9; PHXS is omitted because it is Photoshop. This is CEP, not UXP. The standard source distribution is a folder/ZIP rather than a signed ZXP.

Read **EFFECTS_REFERENCE.md** for recipe implementations, **ARCHITECTURE.md** for ownership/timing, and **VALIDATION.md** for test coverage and limitations. The 3D/glass/extrusion effects are stylized 2D simulations. This package has not been rendered in an installed AE runtime here.

## Regenerate edited schema/catalog

```sh
python3 tools/build-data.py
python3 tools/build-catalog.py
```

Python, Node, Playwright and Chromium are developer tools only; they are not panel dependencies.

## 2.5.1 change

Transitions have been removed from the catalog and host engine. The top tabs are Text FX, Backgrounds and Quick Tools. Existing saved transition layers are left intact until explicitly removed using Quick Tools.

## 2.5.2 — minimal UI and creation tools

The Create bar offers New Shape, New Text and New Solid plus a shared shape/solid color picker. New layers start at CTI and end at the composition end. Shape creates editable rectangle geometry; Solid fills the comp. Preview cards use calmer lighting, rounded surfaces and local system typography. The offline catalog includes disabled creation buttons for a faithful UI preview.

## 2.5.3 checkbox hotfix

Fixes overly narrow checkbox normalization. Loop, Reverse and Manual Progress accept booleans, 0/1, explicit on/off/checked/unchecked text, numeric strings such as 0.0/1.0, and single-value containers. Native boxed primitives are unwrapped. Native expression-driven values within 0–1 use the same >0.5 threshold as the generated animation clock. Unknown values are still rejected instead of guessed.

The inspector no longer uses string truthiness, so the string false stays OFF. An invalid loaded value blocks Apply/Update until you explicitly choose its checkbox state. Errors identify panel vs native-control input and show the rejected checkbox value.

Quit AE completely, replace the entire extension folder, restart, and confirm Settings shows 2.5.4. Load the affected layer, set Loop OFF, then Update. If the failure happened before applying an instance, reset the preset and Apply. No project-wide changes are made by installing the patch. If it still fails, copy the full new message from History, including the received value.

The exact value that caused the reported error was not available. Compatibility cases were reproduced in a host model and checked in Chromium; this is not confirmation of the user's particular native AE runtime.

## 2.5.4 JSON transport hotfix

The reported Keep artwork error contains number NaN even though the panel sends a boolean. The host parser now reads true, false and null directly, independently of numeric conversion or regex capture identity. A startup self-check verifies those values before any operation. Invalid numeric values remain errors; NaN is never silently interpreted as OFF.

A regression reproduces the exact error with simulated string-like regex captures and passes after this change. This identifies a fragile parser boundary, but does not establish that Adobe uses those capture types in the affected installation. Native AE verification is still required.

Quit After Effects completely, replace the entire MotionAstra-FX folder, restart and confirm Settings shows 2.5.4. Select a visual layer, enable Keep artwork and retry the anchor tool. If the new transport self-check fails, copy its full message.

## 2.5.5 — clearer Update and bottom Apply

Update on a selected layer without the chosen preset now gives Apply/Load guidance without an error prefix or unnecessary Undo advice. It never applies a new preset implicitly. Apply appears full-width below Customize on every card, and last in the inspector footer. Host regression tests reproduce the original Soft Bokeh message and verify no mutation on mismatched layers. Native AE and browser rendering of this revision remain unverified.

## 2.5.6 — automatic background layers

Background Apply always creates a dedicated layer at the bottom of the active composition and selects it. Background Update edits matching selected instances; if none match (including no selection), it creates one new background using the inspector parameters. Unrelated selected layers remain unchanged. Text Update keeps its existing validation. This supersedes earlier instructions requiring a selected solid or deselecting layers.

All ten backgrounds are covered by modeled-host creation/update regressions. Native AE rendering and the revised browser UI still require manual verification.

## v2.8 — Pre-alpha

Text FX require a selected text layer and never create one implicitly. Use New Text if needed. Background cards offer Customize and Generate Background. Generation needs only an active composition and creates its own layer; selected layers are untouched. Background Update retains the v2.5.6 update-or-generate behavior. The background UI uses a dedicated generateBackground host action. CEP uses numeric version 2.8.0; the GitHub prerelease tag is v2.8-pre-alpha. Native AE rendering and browser layout remain unverified; this is a pre-alpha release.

### Stability build 2.8.0-stability.1 (same v2.8 Pre-alpha release)

- A late status response cannot release the in-flight mutation lock.
- Customize values, including colors, remain in per-preset drafts for this panel session and are used by card buttons. Reset explicitly restores defaults.
- Generate updates matching selected background instances. Deselect all backgrounds to intentionally generate a new copy. Existing duplicate layers are not deleted automatically.
- Color/slider updates preserve background masks and native effects. Count changes rebuild geometry; older builds rebuild once to migrate expressions.
- Preview rendering pauses during host operations, is capped at 30 fps, and stops after one-shot animations.
- Build checks reload an older host implementation even though the public version remains 2.8.0. Settings displays the build identifier.

Thirteen host/state/preview suites pass locally, including reproductions of the late-status race, discarded card colors, repeat generation and idle preview. The release workflow also gates publication on real Chromium UI/checkbox tests. This does not measure native AE render performance or certify native effect behavior. Replace the full extension folder and restart AE. Old duplicated layers must be inspected and removed manually if unwanted.

## MotionAstra 2.8.2 — Pre-alpha

- All ten Text FX expose a color picker; Apply/Update writes native RGBA colors. Gold/Glass keep their shaded gradients.
- Panning Transition replaces Film Stamp in the Text FX catalog, with direction, distance and fade controls. Existing Film Stamp instances remain loadable.
- Loop mode now includes None (play once, then hold). Static Background freezes the generated design at its start, overriding reverse/manual progress.
- Background duration is a writable numeric field in seconds.
- Quick Tools now align 2D visual layers to composition edges/center and distribute their centers horizontally or vertically. Supports 2D parents; 3D layers/parents are skipped.
- The Create bar adds an installed-font selector: Load fonts, choose a font, then New Text. Current AE font remains the default.
- Preserves single-layer background generation, direct background colors and compact bottom Apply/Update actions.

Replace the full extension folder, restart AE, and confirm 2.8.2 in Settings. For existing Text FX, Load FX Settings, choose a color, then Update to migrate its color binding. Native AE rendering still requires verification; modeled-host and Chromium tests are release gates.

## MotionAstra 2.8.9 — Pre-alpha

- Fixes the startup-blocking `Illegal use of reserved word` at hostscript.jsx line 237: the ES3-reserved identifier `native` is now `nativeProperty`.
- Adds an ES3 parser and reserved-identifier release check, because Node's modern parser accepted the incompatible code.
- Release ZIP includes `MotionAstra-FX/`, `Install MotionAstra.cmd`, its PowerShell helper.
- Installers detect existing MotionAstra bundles by manifest ID, including renamed folders in standard user/system CEP locations. They ask before removing active old copies, preserve backups outside CEP, and restore moved copies if activation fails.
- Payload checksums are verified before replacement. Unrelated destination folders and linked payloads are rejected. Protected system installs require manual removal with administrator approval before retrying.
- Installer enables PlayerDebugMode for CSXS 11/12 in the current user account. No AE project files or AE preferences are edited.
- Windows installer tests, ES3 checks, host regressions and Chromium workflows gate release publication.

Close AE, extract the whole release ZIP, then double-click the Windows graphical installer. Confirm replacement when prompted; restart AE and confirm Settings shows 3.0.2. macOS is not supported by the current build. Direct AE rendering remains a manual check.

## 3.0.0 Alpha

The bridge now verifies the live host before every queued command. A missing or replaced runtime is bootstrapped before executing the requested action. Mutations are never replayed after a lost reply. Settings → Show connection report exposes the installation path, host version, native-effect availability and recent errors; select/copy the report if Apply fails. This fixes a reproduced stale-host failure, but does not establish the cause of every reported AE failure.

FXTools → Glass Surface is an independent native effect recipe: gradient tint, organic distortion, frost blur, beveled rim lighting and glow. It treats the selected layer's pixels and alpha without generating layers. It does not refract the underlying composition or reproduce Glasser's precomp/material engine. Use a precomp containing the artwork you want to process. Existing Prism/Bloom engines and YUGraphic source are preserved.

Download the `MotionAstra_FX_v3.0.0-alpha.zip` release asset. Numeric CEP version is 3.0.0; the release channel is Alpha.

## 3.0.1 startup hotfix

Replaces nested true-branch ternaries rejected by ExtendScript at v3.0.0 host line 380 with explicit branches. The JSX compatibility gate now rejects this pattern. Close AE and install the complete v3.0.1 Alpha ZIP.

## 3.0.2 FXTools native parameter hotfix

Fixes Fill Color match-name addressing, shifts Glow threshold/radius/intensity to their actual parameter identifiers, and converts panel percentages using the native parameter bounds. Existing FXTools values remain expressed as percentages in the panel and saved metadata. No panel or preset redesign.

## Windows graphical setup (3.0.3)

Extract the release ZIP, close After Effects, and open **Install ZxT-Motions.exe**. The black/orange MotionAstra window shows your per-user CEP destination, Install/Update, progress and completion instructions. Choose a release in the universal installer; the latest Official is selected by default. Version information shows the version and included features only. Older/experimental versions require a separate warning acknowledgment before download. Existing copies require confirmation and are backed up. Cancel is available before installation or when declining an update; closing is blocked during the file transaction.

Keep the `Installer` support folder and `MotionAstra-FX` together with the executable. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and WPF are used locally; no downloads or administrator elevation are requested. The optional CMD launcher remains available for troubleshooting. The executable is unsigned; branding does not provide a code-signing certificate or remove Windows reputation warnings.

Development: build with `powershell.exe -File tools/build-windows-installer.ps1`, then package with `python tools/package-release.py --windows-launcher "dist/Install ZxT-Motions.exe"`. CI builds on Windows and tests the WPF window and asynchronous installer.

Motion Curve preset buttons show miniature graphs calculated from each preset’s exact cubic control points. The matching preset is highlighted while editing.

## Font source filters and compact specimen (3.6.0)

Create displays a 24px **M.astra** specimen above Font family. It follows the selected face/style and color, independently of the actual text content and size. Sources: **All**, **User-installed** (AE reports a file in the per-user Windows Fonts folder), **Windows fonts** (system font location plus a known common Windows family), **Adobe Fonts**, and **Other/unknown**. Metadata unavailable in some AE/font combinations stays unknown. Fonts installed for all users or by applications cannot reliably be attributed to the user; they are not guessed as user-installed. Windows family reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_11_font_list . The list is a convenience grouping, not an audit of which files Windows originally installed.

The single-file EXE embeds the installer UI and backend. It makes no network request before consent. It downloads only its pinned version from AmadZaky/ZxT-Motions, requires GitHub's SHA-256 asset digest, rejects unsafe archive paths and verifies payload checksums before backup/replacement. No project, font list or telemetry is uploaded; GitHub receives normal download requests. The EXE is still unsigned.

## Compact navigation — v3.6.0 pre-release

The main menu stays in one row: **Text · Solid · Tools · Curve · Create**, including the supported 300px minimum panel width. Hover a tab for its full workspace name. This release prepares for a later UI redesign; that larger rework is not included. The GitHub release remains marked prerelease and keeps the existing `-alpha` asset/tag suffix for installer compatibility.

Compatibility: `com.motionastra.fx`, the `MotionAstra-FX` install folder, backup folder and existing AE control names remain unchanged for upgrades and saved projects. Historical notes below older headings use the original product name. New online installers target `AmadZaky/ZxT-Motions`; download the new EXE because previously downloaded EXEs enforce the old repository URL.
